                        The University of Cambridge (legally The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge) is a collegiate research university in Cambridge, United Kingdom. Founded in 1209 and granted a royal charter by King Henry III in 1231, Cambridge
                        is the second-oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's fourth-oldest surviving university. The university grew out of an association of scholars who left the University of Oxford after a dispute with the
                        townspeople. The two 'ancient universities' share many common features and are often referred to jointly as 'Oxbridge'.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cambridge is formed from a variety of institutions which include 31 semi-autonomous constituent Colleges and over 100 academic departments organised into six schools. All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, each controlling
                        its own membership and with its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college. It does not have a main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city. Undergraduate teaching
                        at Cambridge is organised around weekly small-group supervisions in the colleges - a feature unique to the Oxbridge system. These are supported by classes, lectures, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further supervisions
                        provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided predominantly centrally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cambridge University Press, a department of the university, is the second-largest university press in the world. Cambridge Assessment, also a department of the university, is one of the world's leading examining bodies and provides assessment to over
                        eight million learners globally every year. The university also operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum, as well as a botanic garden. Cambridge's libraries, of which there are 116, hold
                        a total of around 16 million books, around nine million of which are in Cambridge University Library, a legal deposit library. The university is home to, but independent of, the Cambridge Union – the world's oldest debating society.
                        The university is closely linked to the development of the high-tech business cluster known as 'Silicon Fen'. It is the central member of Cambridge University Health Partners, an academic health science centre based around the
                        Cambridge Biomedical Campus.

                            The University is committed to providing a world class education and access to the very best teachers, resources and support. Therefore, we invest significantly more than the amount of the maximum government regulated (Home) fee on each student every
                            year.
                        </p>

                            At Cambridge, the tuition fee for Home fee status1 students starting their first undergraduate degree2 in 2020 will be £9,250 for the year. The government regulated tuition fee for 2021-22 hasn't been set. It may be different from the tuition fee for
                            2020 and details will be published here as soon as they are available.

                                    and current director of the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology within the university.
